# USE-A-TEMPERATURE-SENSOR-TO-READ-AND-DISPLAY-ON-LCD
This project focuses on designing and implementing a temperature monitoring system that reads ambient temperature using a temperature sensor and displays the measured data on an LCD or a monitor. The primary objective of the system is to continuously sense temperature changes and present the information in an easy to understand digital format.
